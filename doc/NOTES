* Goals
1. Dependency graph
   - Representation (needed or is data-structure enough?)
   - Graph traversal
     - Implement na√Øve traversal initially.
     - Flatten the structure for easy lookup (important for caching).
       Flatten tree such that each level end up as sequential rows.
2. Book-keeping (2 types):
   - Evaluation.
   - Operations, e.g. integrals (integration set, normalisation set).
3. Caching
   - Depends on book-keeping for operations.
   - Flatten the tree for easy lookup for caching.

* Data structures[fn:1]
1. Dependency trees
   - /k/-dimensional tree ([[wp:K-d_tree][/k/-d tree]])
   - [[wp:B-tree][B-tree]]
2. Flattening (for easy traversal)
   - [[wp:Hash_table][Hash table]]: is it well defined for unbalanced trees?
   - [[wp:Hash_tree_(persistent_data_structure)][Hash tree]] ([[wp:Trie][trie]]/prefix tree): derivative of hash table.
   - [[wp:Binary_Search_Tree][Binary search tree]]: since /k/-d tree is already one.
