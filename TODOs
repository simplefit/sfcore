* TODO [#A] Functions & variables [4/8]
A function can be parametrised by variables as well as functions.
Easiest way to achieve type agnostic expression is by inheriting
from the same base class.

** DONE [#A] Function/variable base class
Function base class implementation options: purely virtual, only
determines interface (methods).  Use
- polymorphism (abstract base class),
- templated function pointer for more flexible functions?

** DONE [#A] Functions
Function class: the most generic function.  Data members:
- function pointer,
- vector of base class pointers as arguments to function.

** DONE [#A] Variables
Variables (parameters/observables) are linear functions.  Possible
underlying datastructures:
- inherit directly from base class: a double, or vector of 1 double,
- inherit from function: linear function with a double (overkill?).
- Final: Use separate class with a double.

** TODO [#B] Possible variable types
Types of variables: value, category, boolean
- category: derive from =function_base= or =function=?  The latter
  seems more natural.

** TODO [#B] Constants
- variables with 0 range (min = max = val),
- variables bound to values (=boost::bind=).

** DONE [#A] Function pointer implementation
Fixed signature: (number of args, arg array), (vector of args).

** TODO [#A] Simplify function pointer interface
Bind user provided function pointer to standard interface internally.
Not clear how to handle the input of arbitrary function signature w/o
templates.

- Declaration w/ templates:
  : function(fptr_t<t1,t2> fptr, fnbase_ptr_vec);
- Declaration w/o templates (pseudo-code with Boost.MPL):
  : function(fptr_t fptr, boost::mpl::list<t1,t2> types, fnbase_ptr_vec);
  This probably will never work, since =fptr_t= has to have a known
  signature at compile time.
- Bind the user-function signature with the standard interface using
  =std::bind= or =boost::bind=.

** TODO [#A] Hide use of shared pointers
Do not take function parameters as pointers.  Make copies inside the
constructor.

* TODO [#A] Operators [0/2]
** TODO Mathematical operators [4/6]
Global mathematical operator overloads:
- [X] assignment: =operator==,
- [X] addition & subtraction (binary): ~res = lhs +/- rhs~,
- [X] sign (unary, -ve): ~res = - obj~,
- [X] multiplication & division: ~res = lhs *// rhs~,
- [ ] multiplication & division (with doubles): ~res = num *// obj~,
- [ ] exponentiation: =operator^= (okay since bitwise OR isn't
  defined).

** TODO Comparison operators
It is not clear what should be the implementation for comparison
operators: equal to, less than, or geater than.  Memory level
comparisons are provided by pointer/reference comparisons, or
dependency tree comparison.

Which of the following make more sense:
- scan range, or
- evaluate at point.

* TODO [#B] Integrals [0/2]
** TODO Analytical integration
- Ask for function objects for integrands, and integrals.
- Each integral associated with a set of integration variables.

** TODO Numerical integration
- GSL
- ROOT
- Boost.Numeric.Odeint
- All of the above as user configurable backends?

*** Ideas
- Convert numerical integral into a function.  Integrate once and save
  as I(x) = ∫f(x')dx' (a,x), where a is the lower bound and x is any
  value less than the upper bound, b.  Then any arbitrary range ∈(a,b)
  can be evaluated by two function calls.
  - Look into primitive of a function (suggested by: Koen, and Pieter)
- Ask user for inflection points and kinks.  Then can integrate in
  ranges in b/w the points.  Maybe even have a way to auto-find them
  when not specified (quick scan in steps of 0.01 of range).

* TODO [#A] Testing [1/3]
  :LOGBOOK:
  - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2013-10-17 Thu 22:34] \\
    C++ testing switched to Boost.Test.
  :END:
Testing frameworks:
- C++: Boost.Test
- Python: =unittest=

Test concepts:
- [X] Uniqueness of components
  : sum = (x+y) + (x+y)
  : x → z ⇒ sum → sum + 2*(z-x)
- [ ] Possibility of copies in components
  : sum = (x+y) + (x'+y') (where the 2nd x+y is a copy)
  : x → z ⇒ sum → sum + (z-x)
- [ ] Test with different functions

* TODO [#C] Caching
- Hash the component-tree.
  - Should be possible to update only modified branches of the tree.
  - Look at git tree objects for ideas.
- Caveat: hash function should be faster than evaluation.
- See Merkle tree, =std::hash= from =<functional>=.

* TODO [#C] Fitter
Use generic TFitter to build an interface to Minuit.

* TODO [#C] Logging
Boost.Log

** Debugging tools
Need tools that can take objects and print (to file or stdout)
dependency information.  The dependency tree traversal should be both
ways: dependants as well as dependencies.  Maybe limit to one hop, or
ask for number of hops when instantiating the debugger.

* TODO [#A] Bindings
- Implement getter and setters such that they are easily translateable
  to python properties with Boost.Python.
- Revisit inheritance hierarchy from the perspective of bindings.
